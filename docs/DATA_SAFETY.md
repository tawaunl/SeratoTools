# Data Safety

EZLibrary reads and writes real Serato library files (`database V2` and `.crate`
files) as well as ID3 tags inside your audio files. Because these files are
irreplaceable, safety is a first-class design goal, not an afterthought. This
document explains exactly what EZLibrary does to protect your library.

Every claim below maps to code you can read in
[`Sources/EZLibraryCore/Safety/`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Safety) and
[`Sources/EZLibraryCore/Writers/`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Writers).

## The write pipeline

Every mutation of a Serato file goes through the same ordered pipeline:

1. **Refuse to write while Serato is running.** Metadata edits check
   [`SeratoProcessGuard`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Safety/SeratoProcessGuard.swift).
   Serato rewrites `database V2` from its own in-memory library when it quits, so
   writing while it is open risks Serato clobbering your change (or orphaning a
   renamed file). EZLibrary stops and asks you to quit Serato first.
2. **Write the audio file's ID3 tags first.** For metadata edits, on-disk file
   tags are written before the database is touched, so EZLibrary never commits a
   database-only change when the file-tag write fails.
3. **Snapshot the file before touching it.** Immediately before any mutation,
   [`SeratoBackupBeforeWrite`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Safety/SeratoBackupBeforeWrite.swift)
   copies the target file to a timestamped shadow copy (details below).
4. **Write atomically.** The new contents are written through
   [`AtomicFileWriter`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Safety/AtomicFileWriter.swift),
   which writes to a temporary file and then atomically replaces the original.
5. **Read back and verify.** After a metadata write, EZLibrary re-reads the bytes
   it just wrote and confirms the change actually persisted before reporting
   success. If verification fails, it raises an error instead of claiming a
   phantom success.

## What gets backed up before writes

Before any write, EZLibrary copies the target Serato file to a **pre-write shadow
snapshot**:

- **Location:** `~/Library/Application Support/SeratoTools/Backups/pre-write/`
- **Naming:** each snapshot is prefixed with an ISO-8601 timestamp, e.g.
  `2026-07-22T14-03-51.204Z-database V2`.
- **Retention:** the most recent **20** snapshots per source file are kept; older
  ones are pruned automatically.

This is a safety net that is separate from — and in addition to — the user-facing
**Backup** feature. It happens automatically for every write, so even a routine
metadata edit leaves a recoverable copy of the previous state.

### The user-facing Backup feature

On top of the automatic pre-write snapshots, EZLibrary's **Backup** view
([`LibraryBackupService`](../Sources/EZLibraryCore/Services/LibraryBackupService.swift))
lets you make deliberate, timestamped backups in three modes:

| Mode | What it captures |
|---|---|
| **Full** | The whole library and all referenced tracks. |
| **Incremental** | Only what changed since the previous backup. |
| **Single-crate** | One crate and the files it references. |

## What "atomic" means here

`AtomicFileWriter` never writes in place. It:

1. writes the new contents to a temporary file in the same directory,
2. flushes it to disk, then
3. atomically replaces the original with the temporary file.

A crash, kernel panic, or power loss mid-write can therefore never leave a
truncated or half-written `database V2` / `.crate` file. You either have the
complete old file or the complete new file — never a corrupt in-between state.

## What happens if a write fails midway

EZLibrary is designed to fail safe:

- **The original is never partially overwritten.** Because writes are atomic, a
  failure during the write leaves the original file fully intact, and the
  temporary file is deleted.
- **File renames are rolled back.** If a metadata edit renamed the audio file and
  a later step fails, the file is moved back to its original path so the database
  and the file stay in sync.
- **Verification failures are surfaced, not swallowed.** If the read-back check
  can't confirm the change, EZLibrary raises a clear, human-readable error rather
  than silently reporting success.
- **Missing files don't abort a whole batch.** Backups and bulk edits skip files
  that have been moved or deleted and continue with the rest, reporting what was
  skipped.
- **Cover art and other tags are preserved.** ID3 writes preserve existing
  artwork and non-edited frames instead of wiping the tag.

## Recovering from a bad write

If something ever looks wrong after a write:

1. Quit Serato.
2. Open `~/Library/Application Support/SeratoTools/Backups/pre-write/`.
3. Find the most recent snapshot of `database V2` (or the relevant `.crate`) taken
   just before your change.
4. Copy it back over the file in your `_Serato_` folder.
5. Reopen Serato.

If you used the Backup view, restore from the corresponding timestamped backup in
your `SeratoBackups` folder instead.

## What EZLibrary does *not* do

- It does not phone home or send your library anywhere. Online lookups (metadata,
  purchase links) are opt-in, per-action, and send only the search terms needed
  for that lookup.
- It does not silently auto-repair missing tracks. Missing-track fixes require an
  explicit action from you.
- It does not require network access for core library operations.

## Reporting a data-loss issue

If you ever hit data loss or corruption, please report it — see
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md). Data-integrity issues are treated as the highest
priority.
